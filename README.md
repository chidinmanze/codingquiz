# Coding Quiz
https://chidinmanze.github.io/codingquiz/

This coding quiz is a short multiple-choice activity where users will answer 7 questions on a few basics of web development. The timer is set for 5 minutes, and after completing the quiz, users will see their final score and have the option to save their score in local storage. 

## Features
- Time Left starts at 5 minutes upon entering the game and counts down to 0. Time is displayed in minutes and seconds.
- Question Number shows the user's position in the quiz.
- Score updates as each question is answered
- Color coded feedback lets users know when they answer a question correctly (green) or incorrectly (red).

## Upgrades
Upgrades that I plan to make to this game are:
- Decreasing the time left when a question is answered incorrectly.
- If a user times out before finishing the quiz, showing their current score as the final score.
